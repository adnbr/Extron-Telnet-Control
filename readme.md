# Extron Telnet Control

A small Python utility to control [Extron](http://www.extron.com/) MLS 226 IP AV switchers from the command line via Telnet. At the moment this will control the "Display On" and "Display Off" buttons.

This code currently lacks error handling.

Commands listed in the [MLS226 IP Documentation](http://www.extron.co.uk/download/files/userman/MLC104_ch5_SIS_B_092005.pdf).

**Usage:** extron-control.py [ip] on|off

_This is for demonstration only, and certainly isn't an example of best practice. Use at your own risk._
